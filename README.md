# VTDT - Video Time Delay Tester
Video for testing system video vs audio processing latency.  MP4 video, audio MP3 and original Vegas Video source file is included (minus the blip audio file).

File Descriptions: 
VTDT short 29.97 smpte.7z contains a 2 minute 13 sec MP4 video file with the same audio as the MP3 embedded.  The MP3 file is not included in the 7z however.

VTDT short 29.97 smpte.mp3 is the audio extraction from the above video file.  Useful if one system is playing video and another one, audio and they sync up using some sort of magic: LTC, MTC, OSC, etc.

VTDT.veg is the original project file for Vegas Video 13 that I've used to build this.  You will need to use your own blip sound effect file however.
